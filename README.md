## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### How It Works

1.  **Register and Log In:** Create a secure account to get started.
2.  **Add a Product:** Find a product you want to track on your favorite e-commerce site, copy the URL, and paste it into the "Add Product" form in PricePulse.
3.  **Customize Tracking (Optional):** Add personal notes, set a lower or upper price threshold, and decide if you want to receive notifications.
4.  **Monitor Prices:** PricePulse will automatically check the product's price daily and record any changes.
5.  **View Price History:** Visit the product's page in your dashboard to see a detailed chart of its price history over time.
6.  **Get Notified:** If you've enabled notifications and the price drops below your lower threshold or rises above your upper threshold, you'll receive an alert.

### 🎨 User-Specific Customization

PricePulse allows you to tailor your price-tracking experience to your needs. For each product you track, you can:

- **Add Personal Notes:** Keep track of why you're watching a product, gift ideas, or any other relevant information.
- **Set Price Thresholds:**
    - **Lower Threshold:** Set a price point below which you'd like to be notified—perfect for catching a great deal.
    - **Upper Threshold:** Set a price point above which you'd like to be alerted—ideal for products with fluctuating prices.
- **Toggle Notifications:** Easily enable or disable notifications for each product individually.

This level of customization ensures you only get the alerts that matter most to you.

## 🚀 Deployment & CI/CD

### Deployment

The application is deployed with a modern, decoupled architecture:

-   **Frontend:** The React application is hosted on **Netlify**, providing a fast and reliable user experience.
-   **Backend:** The FastAPI backend and the database are deployed on **Render**, ensuring a scalable and secure infrastructure.
-   **Scheduled Tasks:** The daily product price updates are also handled by a scheduled worker on **Render**.

### CI/CD

We use **GitHub Actions** for our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline. Here’s how it works:

-   **On every push** to the `main` branch, the workflow is triggered.
-   **Automated Tests:** It automatically runs the complete test suite for both the backend (using `pytest`) and the frontend (using `vitest`).
-   **Continuous Deployment:** If all tests pass, the frontend is automatically deployed to Netlify.

This setup ensures that the code is always in a deployable state and that new changes are integrated smoothly.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.9+
- **Node.js:** 16+
- **PostgreSQL:** A running instance of PostgreSQL.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pricepulse
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set up the environment variables for the backend.

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Create a file named `.env`.
3.  Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

    ```env
    # PostgreSQL database URL
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

    # Secret key for JWT token encoding
    SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"

    # Algorithm for JWT token encoding
    ALGORITHM="HS256"

    # Access token expiration time in minutes
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
    ```

## 🏃‍♀️ Usage

1.  **Run the backend server:**
    From the `backend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    From the `frontend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🕒 Scheduled Tasks

PricePulse includes a background task that automatically updates the prices of all tracked products **daily**. This ensures that the price data stays current without requiring manual intervention. When deployed, this task is managed by a scheduled worker on **Render**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Scheduled Scraping:** A background scheduler automatically checks for price updates at regular intervals.
- [ ] **Email Notifications:** Implement a system to send email alerts when a product's price crosses a user-defined threshold.
- [ ] **User-Facing Admin Dashboard:** Create a dedicated UI for administrators to manage users and products.
- [ ] **Price Alert History:** Allow users to see a history of when price alerts were triggered for their tracked products.
- [ ] **Improve Scraper Robustness:** Enhance the web scraper to handle a wider variety of e-commerce site layouts and improve its reliability.
- [ ] **Docker Support:** Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` configurations for easier development and deployment.
